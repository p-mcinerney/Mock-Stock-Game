**The Game**:
Runs game through terminal.

Each round the user is given info of the current stock and its price, aswell with the amount of money they have and how much of the stock they own.

Then they have 3 actions they can do:
- Buy: the user buys the amount of stock specified
- Sell: the user sells the amount of stock specified
- Skip: the user skips the round (Typically done so the stock updates its value)

After the game is over the score and username is saved locally to keep track of highscores.
